    <h1>Learning About Tif Taylor</h1>

    <h3>Biography</h3>
    <p>I am a Pacific Northwest native based in Seattle. My favorite things to do are organize (anything) and practice analytical thinking skills (thinking deeply on almost any subject matter). My natural passions set me up for success in a life that can utilize these skills to their full potential. My personal hobbies include proper tea drinking, video games, social dancing and voice-over.</p>

    <h3>Education History</h3>
    <p>I have a Bachelor of Arts from Evergreen State College with a focus on "Philosophy of the Mind". It was an immersive program that mostly studied reality perception and human interaction. I've been able to transfer the skills of logic and analytic thinking from this program to most any career position. I have also taken various psychology college courses at North Seattle College for fun over the years. Most recently, I have focused on online instruction based around Web Development at places like NuCamp, General Assembly, University of Washington, Udemy and Code Fellows.</p>

    <h3>Overview of Job Experience</h3>
    <p>My professional background to date primarily resides around office and project adminstration. I have managed and organized the tasks and work lives of varied industry roles from ana Office Assitant to a Vice Prersident. My exeperience relyed heavily on my eye for detail, time management and organizational skills.</p>
