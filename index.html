      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p>I am a Pacific Northwest native based in Seattle. My favorite things to do are organize (anything) and practice analytical thinking skills (thinking deeply on almost any subject matter). My natural passions set me up for success in a life that can utilize these skills to their full potential. My personal hobbies include proper tea drinking, video games, social dancing and voice-over.</p>
