**Author:** [Tif Taylor](https://github.com/tiftaylor)  
**Description:** This is the first step in a multi-lab project with Code Fellows that starts with a guessing game about me (the author)  

**Languages & Tech:**  
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

**Resources Used:**  
- Used this [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/link-javascript-to-html-with-the-src/) page to remind me how to grab a JS file in another directory that isn't where my `index.html` file is.
